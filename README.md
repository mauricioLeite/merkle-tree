[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Simple Merkle Tree implementation designed to generate a complete tree from a given list of hashes. 

## About this Project
Merkle Trees are a fundamental data structure widely utilized in cryptography and distributed systems, for efficient and data integrity verification. During this project we will understand the core principles to implement this structure.

## Project Structure
- **presentation/**: Contains theoretical resources explaining how Merkle Trees work and their practical uses.
- **src/**: Contains the source code for a simple Merkle Tree implementation.
- **Makefile**: Automates the build process for the project.

## Requirements
This project requires the following dependencies:
- **OpenSSL 3.0.2** (or higher) for cryptographic hash functions.
